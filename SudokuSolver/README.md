This  is my attempt at making a sudoku solver in C++.  A lot of this was written with C syntax and object construction.  It was written in Qt Creator.  It is meant for beginners and can be shared or copied as needed.

To make it work, include a txt file with the game board written as a 9 x 9 grid of '.'.  Replace any known areas of the grid with number values.  Pass the txt file as an argument to the program and watch it display the solved game board
