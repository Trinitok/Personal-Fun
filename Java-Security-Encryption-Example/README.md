This file will allow you to encrypt a text file in Java using special AES security.  You can modify the file to include whatever security comes with your version of Java (AES, AES256, MD5, etc.).  Just be sure to encrypt and then decrypt both ways.  It is also worth noting that these functions are built into Java.  So it is possible for hackers to go in and just run some brute force algorithms to decrypt the characters.
