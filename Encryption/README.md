This folder will be the main folder that will house all the files I create recreationally. All the files in here will be used for educational purposes to show off different types of security algorithms. I will provide separate READMEs on how each algorithm works, comparison to other algorithms, pros, and cons of each algorithm in the various folders and directories.
