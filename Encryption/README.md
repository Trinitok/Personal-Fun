This folder will be the main folder that will house all the files for various hash functions. All the files in here will be used for educational purposes to show off different types of security/hashing algorithms. I will provide separate READMEs on how each algorithm works, comparison to other algorithms, pros, and cons of each algorithm in the various folders and directories.
