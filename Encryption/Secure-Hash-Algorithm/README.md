Secure Hash Algorithms
--
The Secure Hash Algorithms (SHA) include some of the most secure one way hashing algorithms to date.  They are both a specific type of algorithm as well as a classification.  They were initially created by the US Government as an alternative form of security and have since been released for public use.  As of December 20, 2016, I only have the SHA256 uploaded as an example.  The number following helps to determine the type of category that each algorithm falls into as well as the number of bits that will be output by the hash.  As machines become faster and faster, older hash algorithms such as SHA1 become outdated due to sheer ease to find collisions before security software can detect the attempts being made.  Higher bit count algorithms like SHA512 have become more common for security use because the higher bit count means that most attacks will take longer to perform on any system.   This is because a higher bit count versions have fewer collisions due to the amount of outputs that can be obtained from any given input.\nAs of December 20, 2016, I do not have any computations on the collisions and speed of the various SHA algorithms for comparison.  These will be implemented soon.
