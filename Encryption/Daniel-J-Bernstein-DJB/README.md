The Daniel J Bernstein hash algorithms were created by, you guessed it, Daniel J Bernstein.  They are not meant as encryption algorithms, but are useful for hashing due to their low collision rate.  The reason why they are ill suited for security purposes is because the way that BJD encrypts input is too fast.  Compared to algorithms like MD5 or SHA256, the DJB algorithms compute a hash exponentially faster.  Once I have computed time differentials for each of the hashes, I will upload them.  For now I will simply provide the link below for current references on speed and collisions until I have uploaded metrics comparing each algorithm.
