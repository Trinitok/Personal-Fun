MD5Sum is a 128-bit hashing algorithm that was used up until 2012 to encode files.  Like other MD series, it can be used to verify the integrity of a file.  This only works for unintentional corruption, such as when moving a file between directories.  Third party sources might have been hacked and the integrity of the file will remain the same.

pros
--
-  File verification

cons
--
-  Extreme vulnerabilities.  No longer considered a viable form of defense
